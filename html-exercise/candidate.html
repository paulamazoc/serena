    <h1>S&L Candidate Assessment</h1>

    <h2>These questions use the JSON in candidate.json and the HTML skeleton below</h2>

    <h3>Using the sample JSON in candidate.json and the HTML skeleton below, write JavaScript (in candidate.js) that
        could accomplish the following:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Populate the lists with all of the products, grouped by category, displaying their relevant information in
            the format indicated.
            If the product is available at more than one store, the stores should be listed separated by ', '.
        </li>
        <li>The links should point to: 'http://www.serenaandlily.com/products/theIdOfTheProduct'.</li>
        <li>Populate the select menus with the relevant options. Selecting the options should hide and reveal products
            as appropriate.</li>
        <li>Selecting the LOCATION or CATEGORY option should clear the filter for that attribute.</li>
        <li>If there are no products that match the selected filter in a given category, the category header should be
            hidden as well, and revealed again
            when the filter is cleared.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may incorporate jQuery if you wish, or use vanilla JS.</p>
